## Installation

This framework can be installed using Carthage or Cocoapods. You need to reference this package directly only if you want to use Virgil products with your own cryptography implementation. Otherwise, you will get this package as a transitive dependency while installing [VirgilSDK](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-sdk-x) or [VirgilCrypto](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-foundation-x)
